# Healthcare Cybersecurity Resource Catalog

Purpose: Free, authoritative resources for small healthcare organizations with no cybersecurity budget.

Target: Small clinics, private practices, nursing homes, pharmacies - organizations that can't afford Vanta, OneTrust, or commercial GRC platforms.

Philosophy: Everything here is FREE, OFFICIAL, and ACTIONABLE.

## Conclusion
You don't need expensive tools for good cybersecurity.

What you need:

* Methodology (EBIOS RM, NIST CSF)
* Controls (ISO 27002, CIS)
* Intelligence (NVD, CERT-Santé, CISA)
* Tools (OpenVAS, Wazuh, Nmap)
* Discipline (regular reviews, patching, training)

This catalog = €50,000/year commercial GRC platform functionality - for free.

Start small: Pick ONE methodology. Implement top 5 controls. Track top 10 risks.

That's already better than 80% of small healthcare organizations.

Remember: The goal isn't perfection. The goal is protecting patients with the resources you have.
