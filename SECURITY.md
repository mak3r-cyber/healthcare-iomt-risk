# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our framework seriously and appreciate the community's efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the Healthcare IoMT Risk Assessment Framework, please follow these guidelines:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue.
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability publicly until it has been patched.
3. **REPORT PRIVATELY:** Send an email to the project maintainer at:
   **[VOTRE_EMAIL_DE_SECURITE]**
4. **Encryption:** If possible, use the project maintainer's PGP key (available upon request) to encrypt the report.

### Information to Include in the Report

Please include the following details to help us assess the vulnerability quickly:
* A clear description of the vulnerability (type, impact).
* The exact component or file affected (e.g., `tools/csv2xlsx.py`).
* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (proof of concept).
* Any suggested mitigation or fix.

## Our Policy

We aim to acknowledge all private reports within **3 business days** and plan a full response or patch within **30 days** depending on the severity.

Thank you for helping keep this project secure.
